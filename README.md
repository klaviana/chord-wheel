# The Chord Wheel

The Chord Wheel is an interactive tool for music education, inspired by the experiments from Chrome Music Lab. Its intent is twofold: to both give kids new to music education a better understanding of chord progressions, and to give those with more music theory knowledge a convenient platform for experimenting with chord progressions. Future iterations of the Chord Wheel look to cater more to songwriters, with adjustable tempos and sounds as well as a “beats” feature in the background to better explore melody lines over different chord progressions.

Created with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Web Audio API.
